###Weapon and Armor Proficiency:
A Dark Ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons.

###Undead Companion:
A Dark Ranger may begin play with, or upon killing or raising, have an Undead Companion.  This is exactly the same as Animal companion except where noted, and the same as undead, except where noted:

* An Undead Companion is permanent, regardless of the normal restrictions on undead.
* An Undead Companion does not gain the movement or maneuverability penalty for being undead while being used as a mount.
* An Undead Companion does not gain the intellegence penalty due to being undead.

A Dark Ranger may not have more than a single Undead Companion at a time.  Without a seperate ability to command, or raise undead, the Dark Ranger has no other ability to command or raise dead.

###Track Living:

A Dark Ranger gains the bonus from Track as long as the target is living.

###Favored Enemy:

A Dark Ranger may select one from the following list to be a favored enemy.  This gives a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks against that type.  Additionally +2 damage on all weapon rolls against those type.  At level 20 a Dark Ranger gains this bonus against all living creatures, and this stacks with other Favored Enemies.

* Aberration
* Animal
* Construct
* Dragon
* Elemental
* Fey
* Giant
* Aquatic Humanoid
* Dwarf

###Black Weaponry:
A Dark Rangers weapons carry the threat of eternal torment.  Against enemies with lower than 25% hit-points all attacks deal an additional 1D4 per (class level/4).  Assuming the Dark Ranger is able to Command Undead, all enemies killed by the Dark Ranger must pass a DC(5) +1/2(per class level) will save to avoid imediatly becoming undead.  If the Dark Ranger wishes, and currently doesn't have an Undead Companion, this can be used to re-animate a corpse and raise it as an Undead Companion.

###Greater Black Weaponry:
The bonus damage from Black weaponry increases to 1D4 per (class level/2)s

###Masterwork Black Weaponry:
The bonus damage from Black weaponry increases to 1D6 per (class level/2), and the crit range against enemies lower than 25% health is increased by 1.
